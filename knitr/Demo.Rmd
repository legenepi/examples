# 1 Introduction
We can type the introduction to our report here.

# 2 Some calculations

```{r }
x<-4
x
x*2
```

What if we just want to print the output of the R code, but not the code itself?

```{r echo=F}
x^2
```

Or perhaps we want to give some code but don't want to include the output - perhaps it is lengthy or we want students to fill in the answer.

```{r eval=FALSE}
x+20
```

# 3 Some Plots
Lets make a plot

```{r }
year<-seq(1990,2015)
value<-rnorm(26)
plot(year,value)
```

# 4 Conclusion
Using a few relatively simple commands, we can combine text and R code and generate a report.
